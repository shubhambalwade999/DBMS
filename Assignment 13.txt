1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
Ans-select cname,City,if(rating < 200,'Low Rating','High Rating') from customers
	UNION
select cname,city,if(rating >= 200,'High Rating','Low Rating')
from customers;
select * from orders;


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.
Ans-select sname,cname,cnum,snum from customers
join salespeople using(snum)
where customers.Snum in
(select snum from customers
group by snum
having count(snum) > 1)
order by
sname,cname;



3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)
Ans-select  snum
from salespeople
where city='san jose'
union
select distinct snum from orders
where snum IN(select snum
     from orders
     where odate  = '1990-10-03');
